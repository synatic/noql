Our documentation for the `noql` syntax is stored in organised and separate Markdown files at `/docs/docs/sql-syntax/` folder, we also have a collection of tests in the `/test/` folder that show how to use the library.

All of the functions that are listed as the return value from the function call `functionMappings()` located in the `/lib/MongoFunctions.js` file should be documented in the Markdown files referred to above.

Please can you update the documentation in the `/docs/docs/sql-syntax/` folder, so that any functions which are missing are documented. The newly generated documents should be documented in the same way as the existing markdown files are. Please don't create any new files, I want you to update the existing ones. For each of the new functions you are documenting, please put it in the most appropriate of the existing files. The only exception to this is the `pivot` and `unpivot` operations which should be in a new file called `pivot-unpivot.md`
